        <h1>Lab 3</h1>

        <p>For this lab, you will demonstrate your knowledge of responsive web design for navigation bars as well as
            JavaScript. This lab will be submitted via github.
            Watch the Week 2 videos for more information on how to work with github.</p>

        <h3><strong>Follow these instructions to complete the lab:</strong></h3>

        <ul>

            <p>1. Create a page that has a header, main, and footer section. The header and footer should take up
                a fixed amount of height while the main element will take up the rest. Make sure the page spans at least
                100% of the height of the viewport.</p>
            <p>2. Create responsive navigation that shows as a horizontal navigation bar between the header and
                main sections on desktop, while on mobile it shows as a navigation tab bar affixed to the bottom of the
                viewport.</p>
            <p>3. Create four navigation items with font awesome icons and text each representing a different
                color of your choosing. When the user clicks (or touches) one of the navigation items, change the
                background color of the main element to that navigation item's represented color.</p>
        </ul>
