<div id="mainStory">

    <p id="firstP">
        It was early afternoon when Remus finally, and very much reluctantly,
        opened his eyes. He was lying face down in bed with his head resting halfway
        off his pillow, his arms flung out haphazardly from his body and his legs
        hopelessly  tangled within the sheets. He attempted to kick them free
        without much success  while trying to recall exactly what had happened since
        his return to human form.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus could vaguely remember Sirius helping him up from the  cellar and into
        their room at sunrise, but not being placed in the bed. A  delicate kiss on
        his brow and gentle touch of his cheek were followed by a  whispered, “Sleep
        now, love.” His memories were always a bit muddled the  morning after, just
        one of the many downsides to being a werewolf.
    </p>
    <p>
        His head throbbed slightly as he sat up and looked about the  room. The
        first thing he noticed was an onslaught of sickly greenish-grey light  being
        cast from the window that faced the road. He sighed.
        <em>
            Bloody weather.
        </em>
        Remus had grown accustomed to the nearly constant state of rain and fog this
        spring, but he rather hoped April would turn around with a few good days
        before  its end.
    </p>
    <p>
        He loved the sunshine and the early blooming flowers and the  gentle breezes
        this time of year. Remus huffed. A leisurely stroll through  Regent’s Park
        would do wonders for his constitution, but apparition was out of  the
        question in his fatigued state and Remus knew from the way he was shaking
        that he would be lucky if he made it half as far as Kings Cross on foot.
        What he  really needed was a fix, but that would have  to wait until he’d
        emptied his bladder.
    </p>

    <p>
        He desperately needed to concentrate on pulling himself up  out of bed.
        Remus did so with great effort and began to carefully stretch his  overtired
        and aching muscles. Several places in his spine popped as he stood  with his
        arms above his head, and his knees buckled when he took a few  tentative
        steps. Still rather wobbly, Remus staggered into the bathroom to  relieve
        himself and clean his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
        His jaw was terribly sensitive after a transformation, and a  toothbrush was
        always so harsh against his gums, but he didn’t trust himself to  perform
        even a simple <em>Tergeo</em> spell in his current condition. At least  the
        minty freshness would help Remus to feel more human. Of course, this meant
        that he would need to stand in front of the basin, with that damned mirror
        just  itching to taunt him. Maybe he would get lucky this time and it
        wouldn’t say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gazing at his reflection, Remus took in the unsightliness  that was his
        usual post-transformation self. His face was pale and clammy, with  a
        bristly stubbled chin, bloodshot eyes, and prematurely greying tousled hair.
        There  hadn’t been any new cuts or scratches on his face in a long time, but
        the old  and faded ones still retained a reddish tint that belied their age.
    </p>
    <p>
        Turning on the tap, he splashed his face with cold water and  ran a comb
        through his hair. It helped marginally but the haunted look in his  eyes
        remained. <em>All right. Let’s have it, then. </em>Remus waited for the
        disembodied voice to start heckling him. When nothing happened, he proceeded
        to  add a respectable  amount of minty paste to his toothbrush. He almost
        had it in his mouth when the  mirror’s voice pierced the silence, causing
        Remus to drop his brush into the basin.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh, my!” The phantom said in that entirely haughty tone it  reserved just
        for Remus. “Another bender! You really must learn to take better  care of
        yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Sod off.” Remus replied gruffly, reapplying fresh  toothpaste to his brush.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Perhaps you could seek counsel from your friends or join an  addictions
        group.” The mirror quipped. “It might help you to admit to your  little
        problem, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
        There was no point in responding any further to the bloody thing,  it was
        the same every month. <em>No</em>, he hadn’t been drinking the night
        before. <em>Yes</em>, he understood just how terrible he must look.
        <em>
            No
        </em>
        ,  there wasn’t anything he could do about being a werewolf and would it
        please <em>shut  the hell up,</em> once and for all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, how he <em>wished</em> he could remove it from the wall.  Remus had <em>
        tried</em> to remove it, but the stupid thing simply laughed and  taunted
        him further. <em>Blasted sticking charms!</em>
        <em>
            Thank you very much for  that ‘Noble and Most Ancient House of Black’.
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus rinsed his mouth out and dried his face before turning  towards the
        door once again. He was nearly through it when the mirror called  out its
        parting shot to him.
    </p>
    <p>
        “You need to stop all the boozing. You are far too decrepit  for a wizard in
        his mid-sixties.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’M <em>FORTY-ONE,</em> YOU BASTARD!!!”
    </p>
    <p>
        Leaving the bathroom, Remus had to fight the urge to crawl  back into bed
        and sleep for the rest of the afternoon. He sighed miserably. He didn’t
        know why he was complaining though, it could have been <em>much</em> worse.
        In  fact, it had been far worse before he started taking the experimental
        Wolfsbane  in January.
    </p>
    <p>
        Severus had assured him that the side effects would be quite  minimal, which
        they were with this most recent iteration. The addition of Mistletoe
        created a numbing effect during the transformation, and although it still
        hurt  like hell, it was almost bearable. The powdered Tulsi leaves were also
        helping,  and he was able to retain more memories now while in his wolf
        form. Three extra  Nightshade berries, crushed, allowed him to rest
        contentedly during the long  hours until dawn without the irrepressible urge
        to bolt through his cage and  into the moonlit night.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus was eager to say the least and had leapt at the  opportunity to try
        it. The trial, Severus had said, would be finished in June  and he would be
        able to compile his data and send off for the patent if he was  successful.
        Of course, Remus surmised that Severus had already perfected the  variant,
        and knew that he must have worked tirelessly on the potion to get it  this
        far. Severus never divulged as to why he was being so magnanimous, but the
        sentiment was nevertheless very much appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
        He suspected Albus had something to do with it, what with  his penchant for
        meddling as he saw fit. That knowing twinkle in his eyes…
        <em>
            Just  what are you playing at, you old sod?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus was too exhausted to delve any deeper into the meaning  behind such
        generosity. His energy was being diverted into steady breathing  while
        trying <em>not</em> to wince as he began his descent down the <em>three</em>
        , <em>very long</em> flights of stairs towards the kitchen. The aches and
        sluggishness lessened with each step, but it would still be several more
        hours  before his body would feel anywhere close to comfortable. Remus
        encouraged  himself to push on with the constant reminder of getting his fix
        once he  arrived at his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
        He’d finally made it to the first-floor landing and nearly  stumbled from
        the sudden, low muttering that was coming from behind a curtain  covered
        portrait in front of him.
        <em>
            Oh,  Mrs Black! How could I have ever forgotten about you?
        </em>
        Carefully, Remus  tiptoed past Walberga sleeping in her frame and away from
        the potential  catastrophe. That’s all he’d need in his condition, the daft
        old woman  screaming the place down about half-breeds and filth. Sirius had
        tried time and  again to remove his mother’s portrait, and with each attempt
        had only further  succeeded in enraging the old crone, making her even
        louder and more obnoxious.  Perhaps Remus would suggest some muggle
        turpentine on his next attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was grateful that they had managed to completely renovate  the rest of
        the house. With exception to ‘Old Mumsie’ and that ruthless mirror,  it was
        nearly impossible to tell that this was, in fact, <em>The</em> Grimmauld
        Place. All the claustrophobically Slytherin sentiments had been replaced
        with a  modern, breezy open floor plan full of creams and lavenders. There
        were large  comfy sofas and shag pile rugs soft as clouds underfoot, massive
        floor-length  bay windows with delicate chiffon curtains, and pale oak
        recessed bookshelves  full of everything <em>but</em> those dreadful dark
        art heirlooms that had no  place in their home.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once in the soft-lit kitchen, he managed to heat the kettle  and warm the
        tea pot. With a generous amount of Darjeeling leaves added, he  poured the
        hot water over, his hands trembling just a bit. <em>Blast it all!</em> Remus
        just couldn’t wait; he needed his fix <em>now</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        He glanced up at the shelf above the sink, the one with all  the disused
        muggle items that Sirius just <em>had</em> to collect. An ode to the
        continued disruption of his parents’ pureblood ideology. There, behind the
        panini press and vacuum sealer was <em>his</em> tin. The one that was so old
        and  tarnished you could only just make out the words ‘Keep Calm,
        …something,  something’ written along the side. Remus wearily reached for
        his tin, taking  care not to knock over the Dalek salt and pepper shakers in
        front of it, and  pried it open eagerly to find….
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>What?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing. Not a single sodding gram. <em>Where the bloody hell  is it?</em>
        It might not have bothered him so much if it had only been a small  chunk,
        but <em>damn it all</em>, it was an unopened bar! An entire,
        <em>
            480-gram
        </em>
        bar, of Honeydukes newest chocolate marvel, The Bee’s Knees. He had bought
        it  last week and was saving it for today, just in case he needed a little
        something extra after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
        None of this would have mattered if he’d just saved those Terry’s  Chocolate
        Oranges and Chocolate Frogs on his bedside table the day before. He  could
        have laid there for at least a little while until the tremors subsided,
        happily munching away at the sweets. But no, Remus had been so anxious that
        he  even polished off the remains of his stash in the library as well as the
        one in  the drawing room. He’d needed all of it just to keep himself calm as
        the moon  approached last night. Even if there were any left, he was still
        too shaky to  perform an <em>Accio</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As if to add insult to injury, he’d just remembered the old  writing desk in
        the study. There were some Chocolate Cauldrons shoved behind  the bust of
        Cornelius Agrippa, but it was at least two floors up and his bone-weary
        body just couldn’t make the stairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feeling rather dejected, Remus fell back into his chair, no  longer caring
        for his favourite cuppa. He really wanted his chocolate though.  Nothing
        would ever compare to the euphoria he felt from indulging in a bar or  two.
        Well, almost nothing, but he wasn’t up for any of <em>that</em> today.
        Still,  he needed something to ease his discomfort. Then he remembered the
        canister  filled with drinking chocolate that Molly had given him for
        Christmas, charmed  with an ever-lasting spell.
        <em>
            Bless that plucky little witch
        </em>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus immediately filled a large pot with a generous amount  of cocoa and
        milk. He summoned all his strength to cast a basic heating charm,  then
        reached for a large wooden spoon before returning to the vat. He inhaled
        deeply while stirring his beloved drink and watching the steam rise. Oh, how
        he  loved the aroma of chocolate! Remus grabbed the largest mug he could
        find from  the cupboard and filled it to the brim with the piping hot,
        frothy drink.
    </p>
    <p>
        He resumed his seat and sipped at his cocoa, letting the velvety  liquid
        course though his body while contemplating the mystery of his missing  Bee’s
        Knees. This was just too bizarre for Remus. Who in their right mind would
        steal from him and how did they even know it was there to begin with?
    </p>
    <p>
        He so wanted to try that bar, with its promise of decadent  silkiness and
        crunchy honeycomb. It was probably sweeter than he would have  preferred,
        but Remus just couldn’t help himself when it came to chocolate. He  was an
        equal-opportunist and felt that cacao, in any form, deserved to grace  his
        palate at least once.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plus, it gave him a thrill every time he tried a new variety,  especially
        the more <em>exotic</em> ones, and in his excitement, boundless  questions
        would arise and plague his thoughts for hours on end. Was Mexican  chocolate
        <em>really</em> ever too gritty? Should he choose Peruvian bean-to-bar  over
        Ecuadorian? Could Hawaiian Criollo survive the Rose Beetle this year? Would
        a couple of trees flourish in the back garden? Would Sirius notice if he set
        up  a conche in the larder? Would it work properly with magic, and if not,
        could he  figure out how to rig it up with some kind of muggle wires?
        <em>
            Have I  completely lost the plot?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Another large, steaming mug full of chocolate was called for  and then it
        would be back to the problem at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Who did it? There were plenty of people coming and going to  and from
        Grimmauld Place, but most of them never spent enough time there to  notice
        <em>his</em> tin. The Order still had meetings there once a fortnight,
        although there was nothing decidedly worrying to talk about since the end of
        the war three years ago.

    <p>
        Maybe Dung took it, but no, he hadn’t been seen for more than  a month, not
        since his last endeavor with those spurious cauldrons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fred and George were over last week, but that was the day <em>before</em>
        he’d bought the bar. Although, they could give the Marauders a run for their
        money when it came to mischief, so they were still contenders. How easy
        would  it have been for them to sneak in during the wee hours of the
        morning?
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            No, Remus. You are daft if you think they’d come all the  way over here
            for your sweets when they have plenty of their own in the shop.
        </em>
        He was becoming paranoid in his weakened condition. He <em>desperately</em>
        needed  that chocolate. Remus drained his mug, filled it to the brim once
        more and  resumed his train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry <em>couldn’t</em> do it. He’d been living with them for  the past two
        years during his Auror training and in all that time not once had  he been
        even the slightest bit unscrupulous. However, some of Harry’s friends  had
        been at the weekend for a knees up to celebrate his recent achievements at
        the Ministry. It hadn’t occurred to Remus that someone else might pilfer his
        tin, but perhaps that might have been due to his pre-transformation state of
        mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the impending full moon in 3 days’ time, Remus had been  uncomfortable
        in such a turbulent atmosphere for long. He’d left shortly after
        congratulating Harry, retreating to the bedroom with a good book, and
        charming  his refuge into silence. His fatigue eventually got the better of
        him and Remus  succumbed to slumber as the party wore on into the night. He
        always felt  terribly guilty having to abandon social events in the name of
        his unyielding  lycanthropy. Harry understood though, he was such a good
        lad. So kind, just  like his mum.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, Harry’s guests? Half of them he knew were friends, the  other half were
        trainees of the same department or Ministry colleague  well-wishers. Remus
        ran through the carousel of images in his mind, each person  he’d seen that
        night, and how they behaved. Everyone was relaxed and carefree.  Well,
        except for Neville, of course….
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            Oh, Merlin! I must be going barmy. That’s as bad as  accusing Sirius!
        </em>
        ….. Sirius? .... No, definitely not. He loved Remus with  all his heart and
        would never abscond with <em>his</em> chocolates, not even for  a laugh.
        There were things you just <em>didn’t</em> <em>do</em> to your partner of
        more than 20 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus returned his tin to the shelf, poured himself another  large mug of
        cocoa and pondered further.
    </p>
    <p>
        Logically, it really could be anyone, but somehow, he kept  coming back to
        Sirius. Perhaps it was his addled, chocolate-deprived wits that  had him
        drawing this conclusion, but his heightened wolf senses were telling  him
        otherwise. He <em>knew</em> Sirius though, <em>really</em> knew him. He knew
        him when they had their first kiss in sixth year at Hogwarts. He knew him
        when  the verdict came back guilty, and they were parted for twelve
        miserable years.  He knew him when the Minister pardoned Sirius with an
        Order of Merlin, First  Class and they wept openly. And he knew him now,
        that through all their little  ups and downs, they would always be together
        no matter what happened. So,  Sirius wouldn’t do it… he just wouldn’t.
        <em>
            Would he?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus shook his head and drummed his fingers on the table.  With a heavy
        sigh, he retrieved his tin once more and sniffed the lid. The  unmistakable
        scent of Sirius was all over it. <em>That could mean anything</em>.  Sirius
        did in fact know about the tin. Maybe he’d moved it aside in search of  one
        of the many gadgets they kept on the shelf? Sirius truly had no reason to
        touch his tin otherwise. It belonged to Remus and readily contained one of
        his  most valued possessions. He sniffed again. The scent was strong, as in
        <em>recent</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A swirl of images assaulted Remus. Recently handled,  recently pilfered,
        recently devoured! Sirius laughing madly while holding the  Bee’s Knees
        above his head in triumph. Sprinting out of the room like a mad-man  and
        bounding up the stairs to the attic. Ripping the paper to shreds in a
        frenzied attempt to get at its chocolate-y insides…
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus felt dizzy. He was either over-dosing on sugar from  his cocoa or
        going insane. He thumped his now empty mug down onto the table and  rubbed a
        hand over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus sat there for a long time, contemplating why Sirius  would take his
        chocolate without asking and why he’d even want it in the first  place. He
        preferred biscuits normally, and there was certainly no shortage of
        <em>
            those
        </em>
        in the house. Flapjacks, fingers, wafers, shortbreads, sandwiches… Sirius
        probably had every variety known to mankind pass through this kitchen at
        least  once, <em>especially</em> the muggle ones. His most favourite of all
        were  Raspberry Jammie Dodgers, and he took great pride in letting the empty
        packets clutter  up the place terribly. <em>Another jab at
        Mumsie’s</em> impeccable <em>taste</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus was overtly startled out of his revery by Harry slumping  down into
        the chair opposite him. He looked completely knackered, with his hair
        sticking out even more at odds than it usually did. “Tough day?” Remus
        inquired  kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry shook his head. “Just long.” he replied, running his  hand over his
        face.  It was nearing dusk  and Remus hadn’t even noticed. “Training since
        four this morning. Kingsley  informed us that they’ve found a hideout in
        Lithuania and two in Denmark.”  Harry leaned back in his chair and closed
        his eyes. “I think he wants us ready  before autumn so we can help the local
        authorities shut them down. I can’t say  I’m miffed though; I’ve been
        waiting to become an Auror for almost <em>two whole  years</em>.” He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus chuckled. “You’d  happily trapes around the world for the rest of your
        life if it meant keeping all  of us safe, wouldn’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yeah.” Harry smiled. “Is there tea?” he asked as an  afterthought, looking
        over at the kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes. But I’m sure it’s gone cold by now.” With a wave of  his wand, Remus
        managed to elegantly make a new pot of tea and place it along  with a cup in
        front of Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
        “You’re feeling better then?” Harry noticed. “Using magic, I  mean.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes. Well, I’ve had quite a bit of cocoa to help with my  recovery.” Remus
        replied, tapping at the rim of his mug.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry cocked his head to the side and furrowed his brow. “I  thought you
        usually went straight for a solid bar the day after?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Alas, there was no chocolate today.” Remus said glumly. He  noticed the
        quick glance Harry gave to the shelf and just had to ask him. “How  long
        have you known about that?” He said, inclining his head in the general
        direction of his tin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry shifted in his seat, looking uncomfortable. “Well, a  while I
        suppose.” He said, rubbing the back of his neck nervously. “Don’t be  mad or
        anything, but Sirius told me about it. I’d noticed you always seemed to
        have a bar with you, especially after the full moon, but they’re never just
        lying around, so I asked him where you kept them. He said you were part
        magpie;  told me you have little hiding places all over the house.” Harry
        added with a  slight grin. “Sirius said that was one of your ‘little
        treasure troves’ up  there and told me never to open it. He also said it
        was, um… <em>cute</em>.”  Harry dropped his eyes to his cup before taking a
        sip.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Did he?” Remus asked, narrowing his eyes.
        <em>
            We’ll see  who’s cute when I get my hands on…
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Please, don’t be mad at him. It really is sort of cute.” Remus  frowned and
        Harry quickly clarified. “I mean, that <em>he</em> thinks that what  you do
        is cute. You know… that even after all this time he can still find you  so…
        interesting.” Harry’s cheeks were tinted pink as he stared into the bottom
        of his cup. “Not that you’re not, though. I just mean, well… I hope it’s
        like  that for me and Ginny in 20 years.” He added with a smile that did not
        reach  his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The image of blond hair and a pale, pointy face came to mind  then, but
        Remus brushed aside that thought. There was no use contemplating that
        particular hypothetical as he attempted to bolster the young man’s
        confidence. “I’m  sure it will be.” His answer being vague enough that Remus
        didn’t feel like he  was outright lying to the cheerful boy. Even after
        everything that had happened  to him in his short life, Harry was still so
        positive. And who knew, maybe he  really would be just as happy then as he
        was now. No matter who his partner  was, Remus hoped that Harry would be
        content for the rest of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
        He sighed and continued. “No, I’m not mad at Sirius for  telling you. He’s
        right of course, I can go a bit funny over chocolate. I  absolutely love the
        stuff, and I can’t seem to live without it.” Remus  chuckled. “Sirius
        sometimes refers to it as the <em>other man</em> in my life.”  At this,
        Harry snorted and rolled his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Cacao…” Remus mused,  staring off into the distance. “It’s incredible how
        much of an impact it’s made  on all of us.” Yes, an intoxicatingly powerful
        commodity. It was most precious  to many Mesoamerican cultures. The Olmecs
        cultivated it. The Mayans revered it.  The Aztecs valued it more than gold.
        Thousands of years of devotion. Then… <em>European  Colonialism</em>… Remus
        shuttered. Such devastation. He was quiet for a moment,  contemplating
        whether or not to go further into detail for Harry’s sake. No,  best not
        depress and enrage him just this minute. Instead, Remus settled for, “Most
        people rarely ever think beyond their Curly Wurly…” Harry just stared back
        at  him quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus cleared his throat. “Aside from the inferior sweets  produced merely
        for profit by tasteless conglomerates, there are some truly  amazing
        artisanal chocolates all over the world. Some people still do  everything by
        hand in small batches,” he said in awe, “and there are even  mail-order
        subscriptions to sample all sorts of these confections.” Remus  looked
        excitedly at Harry who in turn was smirking strangely at him. He pushed  on
        anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Did you know that in addition to dark and milk and white  chocolate,
        there’s also red? It’s made from unfermented beans, and it has a decidedly
        fruity note to it. It’s not really talked about much because many people
        don’t  actually consider it to be chocolate in the traditional sense. I
        thought the  sample I had was wonderful. I even spoke with a fellow last
        summer about it,  and he seemed rather eager to try it out himself. He said
        he was looking for a  new idea to patent, which surely was not what I had
        intended when I brought it  up, but there you have it…” Harry’s eyes were
        starting to glaze over.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Have you ever tried cacao nibs? Most people think they’re  too bitter, but
        I love the unparalleled earthiness of an unadulterated bean.” Remus
        continued enthusiastically. “Oh, did you know that every variety has its own
        unique flavor as well, and that even within a particular growing season or
        tree  these flavors can change? It’s all so very fascinating.”
        <em>
            You’re rambling,  Remus.
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry burst out laughing. “You sound just like Hermione.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Is that really such a bad thing?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “She can be rather…”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Brilliant? Inciteful?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Irritating.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry chuckled. “No offence mate, but I think my  brain might
        start to melt if you try cramming it full of facts anymore this  evening.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus cleared his throat again. “Well. I was going to  mention that cacao is
        highly nutritious and that it does wonders for both  muggles and magical
        people, but… I suppose that’s enough waffling, eh?” Harry  was smiling at
        him now in the way that James used to whenever Remus would go  off on a
        tangent, and his heart ached from it.<em> I miss you, you bloody  Marauder</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus sighed. “It really does help, though. Not just to  dispel a depressive
        state, as you might assume, but also with cognizance.” He spelled  his mug
        to refill itself one last time. “I often feel quite addled without it.”  he
        said before taking a coveted sip.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Perhaps I am a bit possessive of my ‘<em>little treasure  trove’</em>, but
        just knowing it’s there when I need it gives me strength.”  Remus said,
        reinforcing his grip around the warm mug in his hands. “Not having  any at
        my disposal usually makes me quite anxious and even a bit shirty at  times,
        something I’m sure Sirius has most likely told you by now, if you  haven’t
        noticed it yourself already.” Harry hummed in agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus felt a bit sheepish at that.
        <em>
            Don’t self-deprecate  or you’ll ruin his evening with your gloominess.
        </em>
        “Right now, I’m just grateful  that Molly chose to gift me this.” he said
        with a little smile before putting  the mug to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yeah, she’s amazing. I’d be lost without those smashing  birthday cakes and
        Christmas jumpers.” Harry commented affectionately, before  pouring himself
        another cup of tea. “So, you’re ok with just this, then?” He  eyed the mug
        skeptically.
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s not nearly as potent, but I think it will suffice for  now.” Remus
        assured him before sipping again. “Besides, I think I’ve had more  than
        enough sugar for one day.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Even for Moony?” Harry chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes. Even for Moony.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Well, I’m glad you’re all right.” Harry remarked, before  sipping his tea.
        “So, what happened to your chocolate? Did you forget to  restock your tin or
        something?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh, no.” Remus assured him. “I distinctly remember placing  it in there. It
        was a new Honeydukes bar, <em>The Bee’s Knees</em>, and I was  quite keen to
        try it.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “But… where is it, then?” Harry hesitated, trying to  decipher the mystery.
        “S-surely it wasn’t nicked?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus sighed. “I believe it must have been.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Who would steal your chocolate, Remus?” Harry asked  perplexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I think it might have been Sirius, for a laugh maybe.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Why would he do that to you? He knows how badly you need it  after the full
        moon.” Harry thought for a minute, furrowing his brows intently.  “Do you
        think it had anything to do with you tidying up after him last week?”  he
        asked nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus hummed. “I have no idea, but I plan to get to the  bottom of it.” <em>
        And when I do, he’s…</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You were a bit harsh on him.” Harry added gently.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus wished he’d had the foresight to cast a silencing  charm during
        <em>
            that
        </em>
        row. “He’d made such a terrible mess of the library,  Harry. There were
        books scattered everywhere! If I hadn’t stepped in and  finished organizing
        for him, it would still be like that.” He remembered only  too well how it
        had gone from there. Sirius was in a right strop when he came  in and saw
        that Remus had put everything back in its place. He just went on and  on
        about his vampire romance novels and how he’d worked so hard to finally
        categorize them by their <em>best bits</em>, as he called them. Before Remus
        could even apologize and reshelve the books for him, Sirius had stomped out
        in  a huff. <em>Yes, that was probably it</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sensing Remus’ perturbance, Harry asked, “Is there anything  I can do? Would
        you like me to pop down to the shops for something?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “No thank you, Harry. As I’ve said, this is a rather copious  amount of
        cocoa and I feel well enough to at least make it through the night.”  Harry
        still didn’t look convinced. “I have a few Chocolate Cauldrons upstairs  if
        I really need them later.” he added. Thinking about the Cauldrons led to
        dwelling  on his missing Bee’s Knees and dwelling on his missing Bee’s Knees
        reminded him  of Sirius’ transgression. He needed to think of a cunning,
        Marauder-esque plan  for getting back at him, something that Sirius would
        not soon forget. Harry was  staring at him, Remus realized, and quickly
        changed the subject. “So, are you  off to visit Ginny this evening?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry’s face lit up. “Yeah, she’ll be at The Burrow after  nine. Gwenog
        wanted them to put in a couple of extra hours at practice,  otherwise she’d
        be at the mercy of Molly’s forth helpings by now.” Harry  chuckled, then
        sipped his tea again. “Ginny said they’ve been working on a last-minute
        offense against the Wasps. I can’t wait to see what they can do tomorrow
        afternoon. Oh, that reminds me-” Harry fished in his robe pocket. “Here are
        the  tickets for you and Sirius, if you still want to come?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Perhaps. I’m not altogether sure if I can take that much  excitement so
        close to my post-transformation, but I will definitely try.”  Remus
        refrained from commenting that he wasn’t sure if Sirius would be capable of
        taking the excitement either once he was hexed with a rather nasty stinging
        jinx to his backside.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just then Remus felt the wards shifting around the property.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius was home.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Hello, anyone in?” he called in a sing-song manner from  beyond the kitchen
        door.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Down here.” Remus yelled back.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Should I leave, then?” Harry asked cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
        “No. I’ll talk to him about it later.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “What’s this?” Sirius asked as he walked through the door  carrying several
        bags of shopping and an aromatic takeaway. “A cozy little  chat. Did I miss
        anything?” He bent down to give Remus a peck on the cheek  before tousling
        Harry’s already disheveled hair. He collapsed into the chair  next to them
        and looked at Remus. “Feeling alright, love?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes. How was your day?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Boring, mostly.” Sirius said. Then he noticed just how alert  Remus was.
        “Have you been up long?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Since half two.” Remus replied.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Really? You usually sleep until at least six. I’m sorry,  Remus. If I’d
        known that, I would have been back sooner.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s quite alright. I enjoyed the silence, gave me plenty  of time for <em>
        thinking</em>…” The scent of curry began to permeate the kitchen  and Remus
        couldn’t help but inhale the alluring aromas. “Is that vindaloo and
        biryani?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius nodded. “Masala as well. From Sitara.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus’s eyes lit up. “Did you get papadum?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius gave him a grin. “Of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Then I love you forever.” Remus replied, spelling the food  to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry snickered and rolled his eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
        As they were eating dinner, Harry and Sirius discussed the  upcoming Harpies
        vs Wasps game, while Remus carefully studied them.  He would nod and agree
        in all the right  places, even comment occasionally on one of the players or
        strategies but couldn’t  care less about the game right now. Sirius hadn’t
        fidgeted once in his chair  during the meal, the usual sign that he was
        feeling guilty about something, and  it unnerved him. It was quite a
        conundrum.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus knew Sirius was the culprit, so how was he able to  remain as cool as
        a cucumber? His lover gave him a soft smile before returning  to his
        conversation with Harry. <em>Why does he always have to look so
        sweet? </em>Remus  could feel his resolve begin to crumble; it was so hard to
        stay mad at Sirius  for any length of time. <em>Focus, Remus!</em> The
        longer he waited to do  something about it, the greater the chance he would
        lose his nerve altogether  and silently move on. Remus couldn’t give in, not
        this time.
    </p>
    <p>
        After dinner they bid Harry farewell to The Burrow and began  the washing
        up. Remus had just spelled the dishes into the sink before him when  he felt
        Sirius’ hand leisurely rubbing his back. He melted into the gentle,  loving
        caress of his partner and sighed contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius chuckled, now moving both hands upward and massaging  Remus’ neck.
        “You seem less tense this month.” He observed, pressing against  the
        surprisingly supple plane of his shoulders. “I suppose that’s the new
        Wolfsbane then, yeh?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yeah, -ah,” Remus began as Sirius kneaded a particularly  tight knot that
        he’d found. “there’s a general… ah… improvement all around.”  Sirius
        continued working at the few remaining knots, relaxing Remus even  further.
        He reminisced briefly on all the selfless acts that Sirius had  performed
        for him over the years. It was almost enough for Remus to feel guilty  over
        his cunning plan, but not quite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius kissed the nape of his neck. “I’m glad, love.” He  said genuinely,
        even though it meant acknowledging the reasoning behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Perhaps you could show your appreciation for Severus’ hard  work, then?”
        Remus proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
        “You’re right.” Sirius remarked, running his hands over  Remus’ back once
        more. “I’ll get him a nice bottle of shampoo.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Sirius.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Alright, alright. So, the git’s done something good for the  world.” He
        said petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        “You mean besides risking his life for the past twenty  years, tirelessly
        working to bring down a megalomaniac bent on world  destruction, and then
        suffering a cruel public, many of whom are still  convinced he’s an evil
        Death Eater?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius huffed. “Yes, I suppose there is that.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus sighed. “Just think about it will you? A few simple  words can make
        all the difference.” He knew it was unlikely that Sirius would  ever bury
        the hatchet, but he was still hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius harumphed. “Why don’t you go and get the vid ready  while I finish up
        in here?” he said, putting the rest of the shop away from  earlier. Remus
        watched as Sirius strategically placed several packets of  biscuits on the
        counter, no doubt readying a selection for his morning tea. One  of these
        was a new variety of Jammie Dodgers, a ‘Limited Edition’ Lemon.  Sirius’
        hand lingered reverently over it. <em>Oh, that man and his biscuits.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus chuckled inwardly as he carried himself to the living  room where he
        then began looking through the selection of muggle films that  Harry had
        suggested to them over dinner. Having chosen something called
        <em>
            The  Terminator</em>, he placed the VHS into the player and sat down on the sofa just  as Sirius
        entered with a large bowl of popcorn.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Ooh! This looks promising.” He said, cozying up next to Remus  and glancing
        at the cover art of the film case. “Although, I’m a bit surprised  that
        Harry would have something like <em>this</em> in his collection.” He added,
        raising his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus huffed, knowing exactly where this was headed. “It’s  not porn,
        Sirius.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius furrowed his brow. “Are you sure about that? I mean  look at him! Big
        man. Dressed in leather. Dark sunglasses…”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Here, read the synopsis if you don’t believe me.” Remus  said, handing
        Sirius the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh, he’s got a thingummy! Ah, um… a pixel!”
    </p>
    <p>
        “A <em>pistol</em>, Sirius.” Remus corrected, then pondered.  “I think. I
        don’t really know how it all works.” He’d never liked the things  anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Ah. Well, I hadn’t noticed that bit initially. Just the,  um… leather, and
        uh…” Sirius chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus couldn’t help his own chuckle at that. “Let’s just  watch the film,
        shall we?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Alright.” Sirius replied, studying the cover once more  while the
        obligatory trailer continued to play. “His hair is perfectly coiffed,
        though. Are you sure there’s no buggering in this?” he grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Settle down, it’s starting.” Remus fussed, as the  production logo
        appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Orion?” Sirius whinged. “Oh, please tell me my late father  wasn’t involved
        with this.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Shh. Many people share that name, Sirius, yourself included.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yeh, but they’re not usually muggles are they?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “They like to be dramatic.” Remus clipped, being on the  verge of irritation
        again, and remembering why he had been irritated in the  first place. He
        mustn’t forget his diabolical plan against Sirius’ misdeed. “Now,  please,
        let’s just relax.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius huffed but conceded, and Remus wrapped his right arm  around him
        snuggly. He was rewarded with the luxurious feel of silken locks  brushing
        against his exposed collar and the faint smell of Sirius’ hibiscus
        conditioning potion. Remus inhaled the intoxicating scent of his lover
        deeply and  eased himself further into their comfy sofa. He loved their film
        nights.
    </p>
    <p>
        The relaxed atmosphere of the room was entirely at odds with  their current
        choice of film, however. It was very strange indeed, with its mechanized
        flying apparatus and derelict terrain. The captions helped a bit, but it was
        still hard to follow. The credits gave way to a darkened streetscape, with
        what  appeared to be a muggle lorry of some kind being attacked by violent
        bursts of  magic, and then a man was hunched over on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without warning Sirius bolted upright. “Whoa! He’s starkers!”
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Oh my</em>… How could Remus <em>not</em> notice all of <em>that</em>?
    </p>
    <p>
        “Bloody Hell, look at the big bastard!” They were both  watching intently
        now, as the Adonis walked without a care in the world. Sirius  turned to
        Remus at last. “I thought you said there’d be no shagging in this,  then?”
        He quickly turned back to the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Firstly, I never said that, and secondly, films can have  naked people in
        them without the need to engage in sexual situations.” Sirius  scoffed at
        that. “Besides, haven’t you noticed the ominous music?” Remus asked  as he
        watched the man walk towards a group of what appeared to be troublemakers
        of some sort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius hummed. “I think you’re right. Those lads are in for  it, or I’m a
        hippogriff.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus had to agree when he saw the small blade appear. What  could that
        fellow possibly do against such a massive amount of foreboding muscle?
        <em>
            Ouch!
        </em>
        Nothing, apparently.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Fuck me! That’s a bit harsh, isn’t it?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “It’s only fiction, Sirius.” Remus reminded him, although he  himself was
        feeling a bit sickened. “You’ve seen real things far worse than  that.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus found Harry’s recent taste in films quite puzzling. He  assumed that
        it must be rooted in his intense bout of auror training, but he  couldn’t be
        positive. Was it simply an outlet for his pent-up frustrations with  work or
        did it go beyond that? Was he living vicariously through these  unrestrained
        heroes and their wanton disregard in the name of justice?
        <em>
            Does he  actually enjoy such things?
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry had recommended Blade Runner the previous month and Die  Hard the
        month before that, the latter of which, upon viewing that Gruber  fellow,
        had unnerved them quite a bit. Whatever Harry’s reason was for his current
        fixation with action/adventure stories, Remus hoped it would end soon. He
        was desperately  looking forward to the day when they could all go back to
        watching their  squidgy romantic comedies again.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Do you think the whole film is like this?” Sirius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I don’t know. We can switch it off if you like?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Um, no. That’s alright. We can keep watching… I’m sure it  will calm down
        eventually. Besides, he hasn’t found that <em>Sarah</em> bird, yet.”  Sirius
        said nervously, never taking his eyes off of the hulking figure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus cocked his head. <em>Oh-aye?</em> “Fancy your man, eh?” He  teased.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Not really.” Sirius said dismissively. “Although… when  there’s that much
        skin taking up the screen how can you not be a bit curious as  to what it’d
        look like from every angle?” He said, staring at the screen and cocking  his
        head to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus laughed heartily. “Oh, Sirius. I do so love you.”
        <em>
            But  you’re still getting a right bolloking tomorrow
        </em>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        They spent the rest of the evening much as they always did  after a
        transformation, watching telly while snuggling and occasionally throwing
        popcorn at each other. By the time they were ready for bed, Remus had fully
        formulated his plan. It was a bit risky, but then again, so was taking a
        werewolf’s chocolate. The next morning, he would have his revenge.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus was up and neatly dressed at sunrise with a hot,  strong cup of Earl
        Grey and indulging in a packet of biscuits. Sirius’ ‘Limited  Edition’ Lemon
        Jammie Dodgers to be exact. How enticing they looked upon the  counter, with
        their bright packaging boasting the allure of shortbread and  lemon jam. It
        would have been a terrible shame to let them sit there all on  their own,
        when they clearly conveyed the potential to be good dunkers.  Remus wasted
        not a moment longer in  discovering just how scrummy they were and devoured
        two before his second cup  of tea. Not bad, as far as biscuits go, but not
        his favorite. Still…
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus had polished off half the packet when Harry came into  the kitchen
        with a bleary-eyed “Morning.” He yawned before sitting down and grabbing  a
        cuppa. “You’re up early today, Remus.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes, well. The new Wolfsbane is doing wonders for my health.”  He said
        heartily, eating another biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry noticed. “Are those Sirius’ biscuits?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yep.” Remus replied, pulling another from the pack. “His  Jammie Dodgers.”
        A grin spreading across his face.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The- the lemon ones?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yep.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Um, Remus? Are you sure that’s wise?” Harry asked  carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus said nothing and began eating yet another biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry finished his tea quickly and made to leave the room. “Look,  I’m uh,
        going out for a bit, it seems like the rain might finally be letting up.”
        he said nervously. “I’ll be back later, then.” He called from over his
        shoulder  as he bolted for the stairs quick as a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus couldn’t blame Harry for wanting to evacuate swiftly.  The storm was
        coming and there was no safe place to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
        The house was quiet again as Remus sat with his tea and  biscuits, waiting
        for the unsuspecting chocolate thief to arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moments later Sirius padded through the doorway towards him  barefooted in
        his worn grey track bottoms and faded black muggle band T-shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Morning, love.” Remus said sweetly, placing the very last biscuit  into his
        mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Morning.” Still half asleep, Sirius leant down and gave him  a gentle kiss.
        When he pulled away, Sirius was staring at Remus in confusion.  He brought
        their lips together for a second time and deepened the kiss. “You  taste of
        lemon?” Sirius’ gaze traveled down to the empty packet on the table. As  he
        looked back up there was uncertainty in his eyes. “Remus… did you eat my
        Jammies?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes, I did.” Remus replied airily.
    </p>
    <p>
        “All- all of them?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “I believe so.” Remus assured him, pushing the empty packet  to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius narrowed his eyes. “My <em>lemon</em> Jammie Dodgers?” He  nearly
        whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yep.” Remus couldn’t help but smirk at the kaleidoscope of  emotions
        overtaking Sirius’ face.
    </p>
    <p>
        “WHY?!”
    </p>
    <p>
        “I was hungry.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius just stared at him, gaping like a fish. “You were  hungry?” he
        repeated, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes. Quite so.” Remus replied nonchalantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius opened his mouth to say something, but the words  wouldn’t come. He
        looked utterly perplexed by the overwhelming magnitude of his  own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus knew it wouldn’t be long before the dam burst.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius’ anger finally won out and erupted with a deafening bellow.  “WHAT
        THE BLOODY HELL, REMUS?!” He snarled. “You could have eaten anything in  the
        house, but you chose to devour my new Jammies!? They were limited edition;
        didn’t you notice on the packet?!” His voice raising half an octave at the
        end  of his tirade.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus folded his arms across his chest and arched his brow. “And  your point
        is…?” He asked coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh…” Sirius groaned, rubbing his hand over his face.  “you’ve really taken
        the biscuit this time.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Literally.” Remus confirmed, a cat-like grin overtaking his  face.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Damn it all, Remus! I may not be able to get any more of  those, you know.”
        he shrieked dejectedly. “Oh, they were good ones, too. Mother  would have
        absolutely <em>hated</em> them!” Sirius spat venomously. “How could  you do
        this to me? <em>Why</em> did you do this to me?” He looked rather befuddled.
        “Did I do  something to piss you off?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus stared back at  him with fierce incredulity and Sirius began to pull
        at his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
        “For Merlin’s Sake! You could just tell me what it is and be  done with it,
        instead of eating my biscuits! I mean, I don’t go around gobbling  up all of
        your-” Sirius stopped short, realization dawning on him at last. “Oh.”  He
        said, his cheeks reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus leaned forward and placed his hands on the edge of the  table without
        breaking eye contact. “Care to elaborate?” He asked with a steely-eyed
        glint.
    </p>
    <p>
        “No.” Sirius huffed defensively.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was too much for Remus. “No?! What do you mean <em>no</em>?!  Sirius,
        you ate an entire <em>pound</em> of my chocolate! What the hell were you
        thinking?!” He screamed into his lover’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I didn’t think you’d notice!” Sirius snipped back at him. “I  mean, how the
        hell was I supposed to know you’d come trapsing all the way down  here in
        your time of need?!” He walked across the kitchen to the sink then  turned
        to face him, throwing his hands up into the air. “Besides, your bloody
        bedside  table was chocka with Oranges and Frogs! All you had to do was
        reach over and  eat them!”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus rose from the table and strode towards Sirius. “I ate  them the day
        before.” He said through gritted teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
        “All of them?!” Sirius asked incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes!” Remus shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius was at a loss for words again, so he just continued  to stare at
        Remus in bewilderment. “Argh! You didn’t have to eat all my  biscuits to get
        back at me!” he let fly eventually, his hair slightly  disheveled from his
        early ministrations.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I didn’t.” Remus clarified. “Just your favorite ones.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Why?!” Sirius demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I felt you deserved a taste of your own potion.” Remus  stated, leaning
        back against the wall by the hob.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius looked livid. “For fuck’s sake, Remus! Of all the  bloody stupid
        things-”
    </p>
    <p>
        “So, I’m stupid now, am I?!”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yes, and a right plonker as well!” Sirius screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus pushed off from the wall, narrowing his eyes. “Well,  you started it!
        Why the fuck did you-”
    </p>
    <p>
        A resounding bang came from behind them as Harry slammed his  shopping down
        upon the table. “Here!” He yelled at them with unwavering vehemence.  “Lemon
        Jammie Dodgers for you.” he chimed cloyingly at Sirius as he handed him  the
        packet. “And Bee’s Knees for you.” he practically flung the bar at Remus.
    </p>
    <p>
        They both just stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harry huffed. “Now, I’ve had it with all the petty bickering  and childish
        stunts. You are both, and I stress the words, <em>rational</em>
        <em>
            adults
        </em>
        ,  capable of settling things in a gentlemanly fashion. You. Are. Not.
        Stupid.  Teenagers. Anymore.” Harry clipped, before heading towards the
        kitchen door.
    </p>
    <p>
        He stood there for a moment not looking at them, then  sighed. “Now, the sun
        is shining, so I’m out for a walk in the park. When I get  home,” Harry
        paused, “I would appreciate it if all your inevitable ‘making up’  was
        either finished with or kept to your bedroom.” Harry paused again,
        seemingly deciding how best to finish this conversation, and still refusing
        to  look at them. “I demand that you both be fully clothed this time. I
        really, <em>really</em> don’t want a repeat of the Valentines Burnt Roast
        fiasco I walked in on.” He  was silent for a beat, then finally turned to
        face them once more. “Do you  understand?” Harry chastised.
    </p>
    <p>
        They silently nodded, their mouths hanging open.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Alright, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The tension fell from the room as Harry turned and receded  out of the
        kitchen and up the stairs. They stood there in the heavy silence for  what
        felt like ages, until at long last Sirius chuckled. “When did Harry become
        older than us?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus sniggered. “I think he was always more mature than  we’ll ever be.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “He’s nothing like James, is he?” Sirius pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
        “No. James would have only encouraged it further, then fell  about over our
        unending quarrel.” Remus mused.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I suppose he really is more like Lily, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Yeah, but she would have hexed us as well.” Remus sighed.  Sirius still
        hadn’t answered his initial question. “So, will you please tell me  why you
        took my Bee’s Knees?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius took a deep breath and sighed. “First off, let me  just say that I
        spent most of my time yesterday looking for another bar.  Honeydukes were
        sold out, and no one else was stocking them, not even Fred and  George.” He
        sighed. “I’ll tell you, I’ve never apparated so much in my entire  life. I
        was completely spent by the time I reached King’s Cross last night.” He
        said wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus waited patiently for his explanation, but Sirius decided  it was
        better to address his feet instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I wasn’t thinking clearly at the time.” Sirius mumbled.  Then he began to
        fidget.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Ah-ha</em>. “What are you hiding?”
    </p>
    <p>
        After a long pause and lingering sigh, Sirius raised his  head and looked at
        Remus. “Um…” He started. “Don’t be mad, ok?”
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>A sentence like that never bodes well.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        “You see, well…. It was those damned kids. I knew it was a  bad idea the
        minute I’d done it.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “What did you do?” Remus pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Harry’s party…. That lad from his department brought it. Evan,  or Ethan,
        or whatever his name was.” Sirius ran a hand over his face. “Gods,  Remus
        it’s been years since I’ve smoked anything… I’m not twenty anymore.” He
        sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh, Sirius.” Remus chuckled, the edge of disappointment in  his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I just got caught up  in the moment… I couldn’t help myself, Remus.” Sirius
        admitted sullenly. “I was  completely off my tits.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus chuckled again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius paused, momentarily reliving his escapade, and  shaking his head.
        “Merlin, combining that with all your chocolate… was I ever  sick the next
        day. I don’t know how you can go about eating so many sweets and  not have
        chronic indigestion.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Werewolf.” Remus reminded him, raising his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Ah.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus was relieved to finally hear the truth from Sirius, as  bizarre a tale
        as it had been, but something he had said puzzled him. “I must  say that I’m
        surprised at Harry. He’s never seemed interested in such things  before.”
        Remus’ sensitive nose definitely would have smelled <em>that</em> on  him.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Oh, he wasn’t there. He and Ginny scarpered off to his room  before that
        Edwin lad even turned up.” He sighed. “Remus… I really am sorry if  I hurt
        you.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus sighed as well. “I’m sorry, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “I didn’t mean to, honestly I didn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “I know, but you still should have told me.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius huffed. “I was embarrassed. I mean, when was the last  time you did
        something so daft, eh?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “I just ate an entire packet of biscuits with my tea, Sirius.”  Remus
        laughed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius walked over to Remus, took his hand, and gently ran  his thumb over
        the back of it. “How sick are you feeling right now?” He  grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Not bad, but I don’t think I’ll want another Jammie Dodger  for quite some
        time.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Sticking with chocolate, then?” Sirius asked, continuing to  stroke his
        hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Definitely.” Remus chuckled again. “We’re a right couple of  numptys,
        aren’t we?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius nodded silently as he stared at Remus’ hand. He  turned it over and
        began gently stroking his wrist at that little sensitive  spot that only he
        knew about.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Oh?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius continued to rub gentle circles along his wrist. Hesitantly  he
        looked up into Remus’ eyes, his own, pleading for forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Hmm… and something more?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus huffed and gave him his best <em>I’m-still-a-bit-peeved-at-you</em>
        glare.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius bit his lip and stared beseechingly back at him with  those big grey
        eyes of his.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Damn it.</em> It always worked. Remus sighed deeply over  Sirius’
        victory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius stepped closer, capturing Remus’s lips timidly. “I  love you.” he
        whispered, placing another kiss gently at the corner of his mouth,  and
        continuing to the other side placed another, and another back where he
        started.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus gave in at last and kissed him back, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sirius needed no further incentive and moments later his arms  were
        enveloping Remus, his hands ever searching, gliding towards his waist, his
        hips, his arse. He was pressing their bodies closer still as he reinforced
        the  kiss Remus had bestowed upon him, one hand snaking its way up to the
        nape of  his neck to draw him down harshly against his own mouth. The raw
        intensity left  them both breathless all too soon and they were forced to
        part for air.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus, their little spat entirely forgotten now, found  himself at the mercy
        of those supple lips once more and he reveled in their  ability to
        manipulate his own so easily. Tongues met with just as much haste,  their
        teeth clicking together occasionally as they fought for dominance over  the
        kiss. Remus could feel the low embers within him quickly building into a
        roaring fire as his own hands were fervently traveling along the planes of
        his  lovers’ biceps, shoulders, and back. Their magic was intertwining now,
        the  force of it causing Moony to stir awake within him.
    </p>
    <p>
        A low growl reverberated from his throat as he backed Sirius  compellingly
        towards the table, his feral determination suffocating any  sensibility of
        his surroundings. Nothing was going to stop this. Remus was  prepared to
        ravish Sirius that very moment and didn’t give a fig if Harry  walked in on
        them right in the middle of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        He continued to guide Sirius backwards, grabbing him by the  arse and
        squeezing tightly before lifting him up. Sirius moaned into his mouth  as he
        wrapped his legs around him. They couldn’t get to the table fast enough  as
        far as Remus was concerned, and in his lust-driven haze he had them both
        nearly toppling over a chair along the way. Out of the corner of his eye,
        Remus  could see the tables’ edge, <em>finally</em>, and wasted no more time
        in  depositing Sirius on top of it. However, he made a <em>sliiiight</em>
        miscalculation in the process, Sirius slipped off said edge, and they both
        hit  the floor. <em>Hard</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        “OOF!” Remus landed on top of Sirius.
    </p>
    <p>
        “OW!” Sirius shouted. “Fucking Hell…”, he panted, attempting  to catch his
        breath as he grasped his side. “My <em>hip</em>!”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Sorry.” Remus’s voice was slightly muffled as he pulled his  face away from
        Sirius’ shoulder. His knee was protesting greatly at the effort  after being
        smashed on the tile.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Gods, Remus. We are far too old for this shit!”
    </p>
    <p>
        Remus chuckled. “Speak for yourself. I’m still a toy boy.”  His knee would
        beg to differ.
    </p>
    <p>
        “You’re only four months younger than me, you wanker.”  Sirius whinged,
        rubbing his hip.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Is it broken?” Remus asked.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’ll live.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Good.” Remus replied huskily, pulling his wand from his  sleeve and casting
        a cushioning charm beneath them. Then his eyes were ablaze  with such heat
        that Sirius nearly melted into the floor. With a lascivious grin  Remus
        descended upon his breathless lover, and pulling him close, captured his
        lips for another searing kiss.

        <strong>Notes:</strong> <strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you all for reading this story. I hope it gives you a  better
        understanding as to how an “Old Married Couple” behaves behind closed  (and
        sometimes not so much) doors. I took a few liberties within this story.
        Mainly, the Lemon Jammie Dodgers, which to my knowledge were not available
        in  2001. However, I felt that Sirius would enjoy them immensely due to
        their  prestige, and as such, I couldn’t help but add them to his
        ever-growing biscuit  collection. Also, the fact that both Jammie Dodgers
        and Daleks appear together  in this story is merely a coincidence and is not
        meant to be a reference to Dr  Who (although, if you prefer to think of
        Sirius and/or Remus as Whovians, that  is perfectly acceptable to me). To
        Sirius, Daleks help to represent the height  of muggle sophistication and
        the bane of his mother’s existence, as do the  Jammie Dodgers. The Sitara is
        located in Islington and I can’t help but feel  that both Sirius and Remus
        would absolutely love this jazzy little place to  bits.
